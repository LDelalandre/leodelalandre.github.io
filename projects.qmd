# 1. Plant comparative ecology

## 1.1 How do plant traits vary with the environment at different organizational scales?

Plant functional traits, i.e., features of the organisms related to their functions and their performance, are expected to vary predictably with the environment. During my Ph.D., I investigated how considering different levels of trait variation (within species, among species, and among groups of species differing in their life history) affected trait-environment mapping.

## 1.2 Can we define a set of (easy-to-implement) good practices to share plant trait data?

Although incentive and recommendations for sharing biodiversity datasets are numerous (Open Science principles, FAIR principles, etc.), the diversity and heterogeneity of standards and repositories makes it difficult for research teams to share their complete sets of trait data in practice. We structured heterogeneous trait (and environment-related) datasets in a trait database (currently under review), and are trying to use it as a case study to provide practical guidelines to ease trait datasets sharing for research teams.

## 1.3 What are the effects of functionally original species on ecosystem processes?

In collaboration with the [FREE consortium](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/la-frb-en-action/programmes-et-projets/le-cesab/free/), working on functional rarity in ecology and evolution, I investigated whether, an under which conditions, species showing original phenotypes are key to ecosystem functioning (e.g., ecosystem productivity, temporal stability, etc.).

## 1.4 How to infer plant positive interactions from co-occurrence patterns?

In collaboration with Alicia Montesinos-Navarro and Miguel Verd√∫, I investigated whether plant co-occurrence patterns can reveal facilitation in the recruitment of seedlings from nurse species. We then worked on assembling multiple datasets of co-occurrence patterns in a worldwide database in order to foster large-scale comparative analyses of plant recruitment networks.
